# # Supersequence

# A _supersequence_ of a string `s` is another string that contains all the same letters of `s` in the same relative order. For instance, `"aabbcc"` is a supersequence of `"abc"`, but not of `"bca"`.

# Given a non-empty array of strings, `arr`, where each string consists only of lowercase English letters, determine if it is possible to construct a _single_ supersequence of all the strings in `arr` such that no letter appears more than once. Return `true` if such a supersequence exists and `false` otherwise.

# ```
# Example 1. arr = ["abc", "bde", "df", "cfe"]
# Output: True. "abcdfe" is a supersequence.

# Example 2. arr = ["ab", "ba"]
# Output: False. Any supersequence would have to
# - include 'a' twice (like "aba") or
# - include 'b' twice (like "bab").

# Example 3. arr = ["aa"]
# Output: False.
# ```

# Constraints:

# - The length of each string is at most `100`
# - Each string consists of lowercase English letters

# '''
# n - length of array 
# s = length of string 
# lower bound: Output: O(1) 
# lower bound: Task: O(n*s)
# Upper Bound: Naive: 
# '''

# 'abc', 'adc'

# example 1: 
# a -> b -> c 
# b -> d -> e 
# d -> f 
# c -> f -> e  
# doesn't form a cycle, so can form a super string 

# example 2: 
# a -> b 
# b -> a 
# forms a cycle, so cannot form a super string
